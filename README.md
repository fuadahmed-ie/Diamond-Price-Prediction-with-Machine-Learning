# Project Name: Diamond Price Prediction with Machine-Learning: A Regression task

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the price of diamonds using various machine learning algorithms. By leveraging features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other attributes, we aim to develop accurate predictive models that can estimate diamond prices.

## Notebook Summary
